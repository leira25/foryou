        Dear Yeng <br> <br>
        It’s been a year, Yeng, since we first met, and I find myself reflecting on the beautiful journey we've shared
        together. Words cannot express how much you mean to me. Every moment we spend together fills my heart with such
        joy, and I can't help but smile just thinking about you. Sobrang saya ko sa'yo kung alam mo lang, and I feel so
        grateful to have you in my life. You are my favorite person, my constant companion in everything I
        do, and the one I want to share all of life’s experiences with. <br> <br>

        You're my favorite person to talk to, my favorite dining buddy, my favorite rival (even when we playfully argue
        about the little things), and so much more. It's so easy to be with you, and every moment we share is simply
        effortless. Mahal na mahal kita, Weslie. You make me feel so comfortable and at ease, and it’s as if I can truly
        be myself when I’m with you. There have been so many firsts with you, Love, and each one is special to me. Even
        this anniversary is a first for me HAHAHAHAHAHA.
        Tanggapin u muna itong online flowers for now; sorry, nashort aq sa budget e hehe! But you know what? It’s these
        little things that make me love you even more. <br> <br>

        As I look toward the future, I can’t help but feel excited about all the moments still to come. I’m so grateful
        for all the memories we’ve already created, and I look forward to many more with you by my side. I cherish every
        single day we share, and my love for you grows deeper with each passing moment. Thank you for being you—your
        unwavering support, your kindness, your laughter, and your love mean the world to me. Thank you for loving me
        for who I am and for allowing me to love you in return. <br> <br>

        Here’s to us, and to all the adventures, laughter, and love that lie ahead. Mahal kita, Yeng, now and always. <br> <br>

        Love always, <br>
        Ariel Pogi Yandan
